  <p>This project is built in General Purpose Ruby</p>
  <p>The Gems used are: curb, json, and require_all</p>
  <h1>Biggest challenge</h1>
  <p>
    Figuring out how to connect to an external data source was one of the bigger
    challenges in this project. I settled on using curb with json in order to
    connect to an API
    <a
      href="https://docs.thecatapi.com/"
      target="_blank"
      >(https://docs.thecatapi.com/)</a
    >and then have access to the properties.
  </p>
  <p>
    Curb itself wraps the data as a string so I had to parse it in order to
    perform the manipulations in my class instance methods.
  </p>
  <h1>Greatest accomplishment</h1>
  <p>
    Being an object oriented project at its core, all data processing and
    presentation to the user is accomplished through instance methods on a class
    that I initialize when the user indicates theyâ€™re interested in continuing.
  </p>
  <p>This is pretty cool, I think.</p>
  <h1>Other notes</h1>
  <p>
    One file bin/program has access to the entire application code through
    config/environment that then requires all of the lib folder through the gem;
    giving the user a simple experience running the application.
