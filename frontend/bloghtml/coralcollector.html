  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>
    For this CRUD application I chose to create a website where users can upload
    and modify additions to their coral collection.
  </p>
  <div class="image">

      width="700"
      alt="coralcollector 0" />

  <h1>Backend</h1>
  <p>
    The database facing portion of the application is administered using Active
    Record and PostgreSQL as the database. I decided to use Postgres rather than
    SQLite3 because Postgres.app for Mac and Postbird make visualizing the data
    much easier than having to rely only on Tux.
  </p>
  <p>
    My models consist of a User and a Post. Users can have many posts and Posts
    belong to Users.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have 3 controllers: Application Controller, Post Controller, and User
    Controller. One of the more challenging aspects of this project was getting
    all three to work together. I have application controller setting the views
    for the others like this
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/coralcollector/1.png"
      height="100"
      width="700"
      alt="coralcollector 1" />
  </div>
  <p>
    so the other controllers can render erb files in directories named after
    them. Both inherit from Application Controller rather than Sinatra::Base.
  </p>
  <p>
    User Controller and Post Controller control, no pun intended, access to
    their resources using a current_user helper method defined in Application
    controller. Here are examples from each:
  </p>
  <p>User Controller:</p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/coralcollector/2.png"
      height="350"
      width="700"
      alt="coralcollector 2" />
  </div>
  <p>Post Controller:</p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/coralcollector/3.png"
      height="350"
      width="700"
      alt="coralcollector 3" />
  </div>
  <p>
    These were probably the biggest challenges on the backend, as well as
    figuring out to use a hidden input field when making patch requests.
  </p>
  <h1>Frontend</h1>
  <p>
    In general, CSS, I feel, is overlooked in terms of difficulty. Many people
    don’t consider it “real” programming, but it can often take as much time as
    writing logic. And if you don’t use it, well, your site doesn’t look good.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that I’m off of my soapbox, another big frontend challenge was
    validating form input.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was not previously aware of the powerful validation features HTML 5 comes
    with out of the box. But learned a lot building this website. (Active Record
    also includes some validation, such as the authenticate method and
    validates_uniqueness_of.)
  </p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>This was a fun project to build and I’m happy with how it turned out.</p>
