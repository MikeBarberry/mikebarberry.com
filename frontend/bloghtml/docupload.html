    Adding Document Upload Feature to React/Express Application
  </h1>
  <p id="caption">6 min read - Nov 12, 2019</p>
  <p>
    Our clients wanted to be able to attach documents to existing “referrals” in
    the system. Creating this was one of the biggest tasks I took on as a
    developer on ConnexRX.
  </p>

  </div>
  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>
    I knew that the website was already set up using tabs. And the client did
    not provide any instruction on exactly how this feature should be
    implemented. They just knew what they wanted to see in a few weeks. My first
    task was to brainstorms design ideas to implement the feature in a way that
    would look as natural as possible. Hence, placing the main entry point into
    the feature on a new tab was the route I chose.
  </p>
  <h1>Implementation</h1>
  <p>
    First things first, I had to create a new route in app.js to serve the new
    component I was going to make.
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/docupload/route.png"
      alt="docupload protected route"
      height="31"
      width="700" />
    <p id="caption">route for the documentation component</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Users find the Add Documentation button when editing a “referral”: it’s not
    possible to attach a file to a referral that doesn’t exist yet. Routing for
    the edit page is set up similarly; so I knew I was going to have access to
    the ID. I store this in state when the component mounts, and then push a new
    route onto history.props when the add button is clicked.
  </p>

  </div>
  <p>
    Whala! We’re now on the right page, ready to start uploading our file. Here
    is when the fun begins…
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to simply uploading a file, the clients wanted to be able to
    also associate some information with that document. You might recall talk
    earlier about tabs; turns out in this site, they can be important since that
    is how different types of treatment are split up. Additionally, there are
    permissions attached to each of the tabs based on how much access the
    administrators award. It is an important piece of information. So much so,
    in fact, that users aren’t able to continue to actually upload their file
    without entering information in these fields.

  <p>
    Here is where the magic really happens. Clicking the icon or surrounding
    area opens a prompt on the user’s machine to select a local file. What this
    does is actually load an arrayBuffer into memory.

    We will be uploading this to S3 directly from the front end. But not before
    we make a request to the back end and received a pre-signed URL.

  <p>
    Express receives a request from the React component, runs this function, and
    then returns the URL if all goes well.

    <p id="caption">chained requests to get the url and then upload</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    React has to perform two operations in sequence: first it asks for the URL
    from the back end, then it goes ahead and makes another request to that URL
    to actually upload the file from memory and into S3.
  </p>
  <p>
    (Note: the file isn’t actually uploaded until all of the steps are completed
    and the user confirms their intent to complete the operation.) They have one
    more choice to make before then.

    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Our clients wanted the ability to send an email notification to other users
    they thought might be interested to know a patient just had a file uploaded
    for them. But…they didn’t just want to be able to select any other user.
    Only certain user groups have permission to access any given patients
    information. It wouldn’t make sense to show a list of all of potential
    recipients if only a subset had access to this patient’s data. Here is where
    a bit of code comes to the rescue to search the database for relevant
    potential recipients and filter them out.

      logic to find only users who have been given consent and have their

    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    With a bit of code-jitsu we are able to find only users who have access to
    the data for the patient who a document is being added for, and who has
    their notifications turned on (a separate feature allows users to decided
    whether they want to receive emails from the application or not).

    <p id="caption">

  <p>
    If a user, or multiple users, are selected to receive an email, the back end
    runs a function that uses SES to send.

  <p>Finally, we can process the upload!</p>
  <div class="image">

      src="/blog/docupload/11.png"
      alt="docupload 11"
      height="115"
      width="432" />
    <p id="caption">hooray!</p>
  </div>
  <p>Now we see our upload on the original page we started from.</p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/docupload/12.png"
      alt="docupload 12"
      height="348"
      width="700" />
    <p id="caption">uploaded document</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Some more code runs behind this because business logic dictated that users
    who do not have consent (remember that idea from the notification filter?)
    are not allowed to see uploads that have the category as anything other than
    either “referral” or “demographics”.
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/docupload/13.png"

      width="700" />
    <p id="caption">business logic authorization code</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    So this bit of code runs in the background to determine which list of docs
    to show the current user.
  </p>
  <h1>Wrapping Up</h1>
  <p>
    By this point, we’ve covered most of it. Except, what happens if a user
    wants to delete a document? I’m glad you asked.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similar to how the process to upload a file required a multiple chained
    asynchronous operations, deleting does too.
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/docupload/14.png"
      alt="docupload 14"
      height="755"
      width="700" />
    <p id="caption">code to delete an upload</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Since we have metadata stored in MongoDB and the actual file stored in AWS,
    I had to figure out a way to delete both entries.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, the data is structured so that the “referral” (i.e. patient)
    holds a reference to the IDs of the Documents attached to it; and the
    Document model contains a reference to the Referral it is associated with.
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/docupload/15.png"
      alt="docupload 15"
      height="348"
      width="700" />
    <p id="caption">
      document model with reference to the referral it belongs to; and a
      Mongoose ‘pre’ middleware function
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    What it happening here is that when a document is deleted, this ‘pre’
    middleware function automatically runs. When .deleteOne() is called, I pass
    the ID of the document to be deleted, and also referralId and documentId to
    the middleware. Which makes use of these values as it finds the referralId
    that contains a reference to the file to be deleted, and removes it from its
    own array of documents. In all, we are deleting the document metadata with
    Document.deleteOne(), the reference to this document in the referral that it
    used to belong to, and the file itself on S3.
  </p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>
    One of the biggest features I’ve worked on so far in my engineering career,
    it was fun, challenging and rewarding to develop this and I think the
    clients were pleased with the results.
