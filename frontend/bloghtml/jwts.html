  <h1 class="title">Using JWTs for Authentication & Security</h1>
  <p id="caption">5 min read - Oct 12, 2019</p>
  <p>
    A lot of people have questions about this topic and there aren’t many good
    answers available on the internet. This post will present one way to use
    json web tokens (jwt).
  </p>
  <p>
    Many options are available to authenticate users — alternate strategies
    involves cookies and sessions. Local storage and axios will be the tools
    used here.
  </p>
  <h1>What is a json web token?</h1>
  <p>
    Json web tokens are encrypted messages that take input and a secret to
    output coded data. Three sections are included in the product are: header,
    payload, and signature. Only the signature is private. Header and payload
    can be easily decrypted using free tools like
    <a
      href="https://www.jstoolset.com/jwt"
      target="_blank"
      >https://www.jstoolset.com/jwt</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Signature verification is performed using the same secret that is used
    during encoding.

    <p id="caption">jwt verification with the secret hidden</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Only people with this signature can verify a token. Verification normally
    happens on the backend for this reason — all frontend code is public; making
    this secret available there would be a security concern. Think of it like
    API credentials.
  </p>
  <h1>Local Storage</h1>
  <p>
    After a jwt has been generated, it is common for it to be sent to the
    frontend and stored in local storage. Local storage for a website is
    available to all pages and between reloads. Data placed there will remain
    until it is explicitly cleared. It’s not necessarily a risk to place a jwt
    there because of the signature discussed above. Payloads should not contain
    sensitive information because that part of the token can be easily decoded.
    Hammering this point home:
    <i
      >the header and payload section of a jwt can be easily decoded; the
      signature cannot be decoded without the secret used to create it. Do not
      send the secret to the frontend.</i
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Payloads can contain any data. Common properties include username, email
    address, id number, and any other identifying information for the user who
    logged in to the application.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is common for local storage is formatted with keys and values. It is
    common for jwts to include the word “Bearer” before the actual token.

  </div>
  <p>
    Notice the periods (.) in the jwt — these are the section breaks between the
    three parts.
  </p>
  <h1>Axios</h1>
  <p>
    Axios is a package that makes working with the fetch api easier. One feature
    is the ability to add headers to requests that stick until removed.
  </p>

      backend to setting it as an axios header</i

      api call to login route on backend — with the token: receives it, stores
      in local storage, sets axios header, decodes it, and stores decoded data
      in Redux
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Magic behind the scenes from local storage and setting the axios header
    (photos above) is exposed in this function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Redux is used in this application. It isn’t necessary, but allows all
    components to access data about the current user from the store. Both axios
    and redux are time saving tools. Alternately, headers could be set and data
    decoded with each request/response to/from the backend.
  </p>
  <h1>Redux</h1>
  <p>
    One downside to using Redux is the lack of data persistence between page
    reloads. To get around this, app.js (the root component in React
    applications) contains a conditional to look into local storage.
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/jwts/4.png"
      alt="jwts 4"
      height="467"
      width="700" />
    <p id="caption">

    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Many of the same functions are repeated here as a way for app.js to catch
    whether the user logged out. If not, re-dispatch Redux action, unless the
    jwt expired.
  </p>
  <p>
    Jwts have expiration dates to further improve security. After expiration,
    the application will automatically log the user out.
  </p>
  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>
    Jwts are sometimes misrepresented on the internet. Not without good reason
    as using them, especially with local storage, can be confusing.
    Authentication can be one of the most technical and complicated aspects of
    an application and in the website discussed above, it certainly is.
  </p>
  <p>
    Multiple moving parts are involved due to the nature of the feature spanning
    across both ends of the application and involving a number of different
    packages and pages.
  </p>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>User starts on unauthenticated page and logs in</li>
      <li>Redux action is dispatched after log in button is clicked</li>
      <li>
        Backend looks up user, takes their data and encodes the information in a
        jwt signed with a secret
      </li>
      <li>
        Frontend receives the token — saves the raw encoded token in local
        storage, decodes the token, and stores the decrypted data in Redux
      </li>
      <li>
        Token is stored as an axios header for all subsequent requests to the
        backend while the user is signed in
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h1>*Extra Credit* Protected Route</h1>
  <p>
    React has an ability to use protected routes that require authentication to
    view the components.
  </p>
  <p>
    A protected route is essentially a wrapper component that checks if the user
    is authenticated (from Redux; when they are logged in the user data is
    passed in to the store along with a new property called isAuthenticated that
    is a boolean). Users for whom this is true are shown the protected
    component. Others are redirected to the login page.
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/jwts/5.png"
      alt="jwts 5"
      height="624"
      width="700" />
    <p id="caption">
      protected route checking isAuthenticated property and showing protected
      component if true
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Header, sider and footer components are added in with the protected
    component to create a complete webpage with all of the features intended for
    the logged in users to have.
  </p>
  <p>In app.js the protected routes look like this:</p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/jwts/6.png"
      alt="jwts 6"
      height="200"
      width="432" />
    <p id="caption">protected routes</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Every component where authentication is required uses a protected route.
    Components that anyone can access use regular Route from react-router-dom.
