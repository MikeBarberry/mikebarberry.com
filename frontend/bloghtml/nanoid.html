    Our clients didn’t want to see the default 24 digit MongoDB ID on the
    frontend. But still wanted to be able to identify patients by some
    identifying number.
  </p>
  <h1>Researching the right solution</h1>
  <p>
    First, we had to determine what the correct approach to solve this problem
    was. Shortid emerged initially simply due to the fact that the name is the
    most obvious solution. Their npm page greets visitors with a warning in
    large font…okay maybe this isn’t going to work? In the warning is a
    reference to a similar package, nanoid.

  <p>
    About 149 billion years until a 1% probability of a collision? Yeah, that
    should work. But at 21 characters that doesn’t really solve our user’s
    concern about a long ID: we’re only shaving off 3 digits at that point.
    Working with this calculator for a while we decided that 8 digits would be a
    good compromise between convenience and security for our application.
    “Referrals”, the main collection in our MongoDB database our users are
    concerned with aren’t being added at an incredible rate; more like a few per
    day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Great! Now we have a package that we can integrate into the application.
    Let’s actually do that.

  <h1>Adding Nanoid to the Website</h1>

      function to automatically add nanoids to newly created “referrals”
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    MongoDB is used as the database for this application, as mentioned. We also
    use Mongoose as the ODM. Referrals have a model on the backend that
    describes the structure of documents in that collection. If a property isn’t
    included in the model, it won’t be added. What we did is add a function that
    automatically creates a nanoid when a new referral is added.
  </p>
  <p>
    What about users that already exist in the system? Great question. Since
    this function only runs when a referral is created, it will not add nanoids
    to existing documents. So now what? For this I wrote a Node.js script that
    connects to the database, creates a nano_id property and stores a nanoid as
    the value.
  </p>
  <h1>Displaying the New Nanoid to Users</h1>
  <p>
    To briefly recap where we are right now, we have determined our approach to
    solving this problem, added some code to automatically generate secondary
    IDs when a new referral is created, and wrote a script to add IDs to
    existing referrals. To this point, our changes only exist on the backend.
    Users do not yet see the new IDs on the UI.

    is code that generates table columns to go in the ant design table
    component.
  </p>
  <p>
    MongoDB’s default ID is still used behind the scenes. We’re just not showing
    it to the users anymore.
  </p>
  <h1>Wrapping Up</h1>
  <p>
    Finally, the nano_id has to be sent with updates to the backend. When a user
    edits a referral, we need to send the referral’s nanoid with the rest of the
    data payload so that it doesn’t keep getting overwritten each time something
    else changes: this ID is meant to be consistent.

    <p id="caption">

  </div>
  <p>
    Edit pages are form elements. When a user clicks to submit their changes, an
    onFinish function runs to process the data before sending it to the
    application server for eventual storage. Above, our React function performs
    some operations before making a fetch request (we use Axios). Nanoids aren’t
    coming from the form. They are coming directly from the server when the edit
    page loads, and are stored in state. So we add them in with the rest of the
    values. When the backend function receives the data, it stores this value as
    it overwrites the existing data; thus preserving the nanoid between saves.
