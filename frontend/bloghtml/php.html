  <h1 class="title">Migrating a Project from PHP to Vue</h1>

    When I started in my coding journey, one of the first websites I built was a
    simple CRUD application based on html forms. It worked, and was hosted on
    AWS EC2. But as I learned more about coding, I decided to switch the
    technology behind the scenes from HTML/PHP to Vue/Express. This post
    describes that transition.

  <h1>Before the Transition</h1>
  <p>
    The basic inital structure was an index.html page with a form section that
    triggered a php file to process data and a button that linked to another php
    file that displayed all of the data in the database.
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/php/1.png"
      height="254"
      width="700"
      alt="php 1" />
    <p id="caption">form on index.html</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    This structure was fundamentally changed after the shift to Vue and the
    application became a SPA. In the first version, there were two php files
    that just processed data (the action.php file shown above that added new
    data and an update.php file that either edited or deleted data based on user
    input) and one php file that was a combination of html and php to connect to
    the database and display that data to the user.
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/php/2.png"
      height="429"
      width="700"
      alt="php 2" />
    <p id="caption">example of data shown to user</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    After the shift to Vue, this structure was completely changed. Index.html
    became only a place to mount the Vue application to the DOM and page reloads
    are gone — the entire frontend is now JavaScript.
  </p>
  <div class="image">
    <img
      src="/blog/php/3.png"
      height="660"
      width="700"
      alt="php 3" />
    <p id="caption">vue home component</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    The form element that was in index.html is now in a Vue component. Rather
    than having and action attribute, clicking the button triggers a function
    that submits the data. And instead of redirecting the user to another file,
    Vue router is used to shift users over to the page to view the stored data.
  </p>
  <h1>Why Vue?</h1>
  <p>
    Why not React or vanilla JavaScript? Well the answer was simple really, the
    structure of Vue components with template, script and style sections allowed
    for a very smooth transition. Html was able to be pasted into the template
    section with few modifications. Then in the style tag the CSS for each
    specific component was neatly added directly into the file where it was
    appropriate rather than having to have one long file. React would have also
    been adequate, but Vue seemed like the more natural fit.
  </p>
  <h1>What About the Backend?</h1>
  <p>
    You might have asked yourself, “what about the backend?”. Since php is able
    to process data for a database and Vue only handles the frontend of the
    application. ExpressJS was selected as the new backend technology for this
    application. Working with one language on both ends of an application is
    welcome and Express is fast, reliable and easy to get up-and-running.

      alt="php 4" />
    <p id="caption">express routes that serve data from different endpoints</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Express is paired with Mongoose ODM and MongoDB to form the complete REST
    API structure.
  </p>
  <h1>Deploying the Application</h1>
  <p>
    One of the more difficult aspects of getting this website fully up and
    running was the deployment step. It is hosted on Heroku and available on the
    world wide web at www.friendslist.link. Originally it was on Amazon EC2
    running Amazon Linux 2, however this method required SSHing into the server
    to set up a lot of configuration, like installing PHP, Let’s Encrypt for
    https and getting the Apache server running. Heroku is a more
    straightforward option as they perform the config for you. But this wasn’t
    without it’s own challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    Building a Vue application is different than React applications. Create
    React App (CRA) and Vue CLI each have their own implementations of Webpack
    and Babel. React-scripts, the default build package with CRA is a
    automatically listed as a frontend dependency and installed by Heroku.
    Vue-cli-service, the default Vue build package, on the other hand, is not —
    it is a globally installed package on my local machine. This caused some
    issues for Heroku.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get around this, the finished Vue application is built locally with
    <strong>npm run build</strong> and this version is what is uploaded to
    GitHub and then built with Heroku. Confusing? Yeah. The main takeaway
    difference is that Heroku can build React applications from pure source
    code; whereas with Vue code, at least in my implementation, Heroku required
    the pre-complied and bundled version.
  </p>
  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>
    Working through this transition was a fun process. Vue is a great frontend
    framework that is at the same time similar to and very different from React.
    Each have their own strengths and weaknesses. PHP is a great language for
    getting up and running quickly. Other choices might produce cleaner results.
