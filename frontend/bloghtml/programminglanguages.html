  <h1 class="title">Programming Languages in 2019: An Overview</h1>
  <p id="caption">5 min read - Oct 13, 2019</p>
  <p>
    Modern web development presents engineers with an array of programming
    language options, especially on the back end. This post will provide an
    overview of popular choices.
  </p>
  <h1>Java</h1>
  <p>
    Released in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, Java has been a mainstay language for
    many years. Oracle now owns the technology. Java is a statically typed
    language — meaning there is a separate build phase before the program can be
    run. To use this language on your local machine it is often necessary to
    download the Java library of source code and a Java Virtual Machine. It is
    commonly taught in college courses.

  </div>
  <p>
    Java can be used for web development with back end frameworks like Spring.
    It is very popular in Android application development and is the inspiration
    for another language called Kotlin.
  </p>
  <h1>C#</h1>
  <p>
    Anders Hejlsberg is credited as the lead Microsoft engineer responsible for
    the development of C#(C sharp). Like Java, C# is a statically typed
    language. It is the base of the .NET framework and ASP.NET — used for back
    end web development.
  </p>
  <p>
    While functional on Linux, Windows and Mac, it is mostly targeted towards
    creating products to run on the Windows operating system.

  <h1>Python</h1>
  <p>
    Originally released in 1991, Python has been around for over 30 years and
    has become increasing popular recently. Python is a dynamically-typed
    language unlike Java and C#; meaning it does not require a dedicated
    compilation phase. Type checking is performed at run time. Django and Flask
    are popular Python web frameworks. The language has built in features for
    working with numbers, making it a popular choice for data scientists and
    economists. It is also a popular choice for machine learning. Ruby and
    Python share some syntactic similarities. Both languages emphasize brevity
    and steer away from curly braces.
  </p>
  <p>Python is often considered one of the fastest dynamic languages.</p>

  <h1>Swift</h1>
  <p>
    Swift is not a language used in web development. But is very popular for
    mobile devices that run iOS. It was created by Apple and first released in
    2014. Objective-C was its precursor and there are some connections to C and
    C++. It is statically typed.

  <h1>PHP</h1>
  <p>
    Originally standing for Personal Home Page and released in 1994 by Rasmus
    Lerdorf, PHP was intended for web development since its inception. Beginners
    sometimes find this language the easiest to get started with as there are
    many resources available online and it integrates almost seamlessly with
    HTML. The Apache web server works very well with PHP.
  </p>
  <p>
    Composer was released in 2012 as a PHP package manager. One year earlier
    Laravel debuted and is a powerful back end framework for web development. A
    lighter weight alternative is called Symfony.
  </p>
  <p>
    PHP has received some criticism due to the flexibility it provides to
    developers that can result in sloppy code.

  <h1>JavaScript</h1>
  <p>
    Inspired in name, JavaScript is actually unrelated to Java. It is
    dynamically typed and has gone through significant revisions in recent
    years. Previously considered somewhat difficult to use, ES6 introduced new
    features that improved the language. NodeJS is the backend implementation of
    JavaScript that runs outside of the browser. Although it uses the same V8
    engine developed by Google and used in Chrome.
  </p>
  <p>
    JavaScript is unique in that is enjoys a monopoly over the front end of web
    development. Early in the lifecycle of the world wide web many languages
    were competing for browser preeminence. The community landed on JS as a
    common solution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Multiple frameworks have arisen to simplify the process of creating user
    interfaces such as React, Angular and Vue. Each has their own unique take on
    on how to structure components. Angular is commonly considered the heaviest
    of the three. React is supported by Facebook; and Vue is community
    maintained.
  </p>
  <p>
    TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds type checking and was
    created by Microsoft

  <h1>Ruby</h1>
  <p>
    Created in 1995 by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto in Japan, Ruby has a supportive
    community of engineers. It was founded with the philosophy that a
    programming language should be enjoyable to use. The syntax of the language
    reflects this sentiment and many useful methods are available in the core
    library.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ruby on Rails was released in 2004 and lead to many organizations adopting
    Ruby to build websites. Big companies that still use Ruby include Github and
    Twitter. It is widely considered one of the easiest languages to take an
    idea to a MVP in a short time. Sinatra is a lighter alternative to Rails.
  </p>
  <p>
    Excitement for Ruby has waned in recent years and it is often looked over in
    favor of newer or more fashionable languages.

  <h1>Go</h1>
  <p>
    Created by Google and first released in 2009, Go (often mislabeled as
    Golang) is a statically-typed compiled language. It is syntactically
    somewhat similar to C/C++. But can be considered easier to use due to type
    inference and the ability to run programs without a dedicated compile phase
    with the go run command. Packages are easy to find and import using
    pkg.go.dev. Gin, a web framework, allows developers to quickly create an
    application server. It is widely used in production at Google and is one of
    the hottest programming languages.

  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>
    Choice of programming language is an important decision because each one has
    its own pros and cons. Large corporations have a tendency to favor
    statically typed languages while startups prefer dynamic options. Mostly due
    to the tradeoffs between reliability and speed of production. Dynamic
    languages are typically more enjoyable to work with being less verbose.
  </p>
  <p>Notable languages not mentioned are C++, Scala and Haskell.</p>
