  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>
    This project uses the fetch API to communicate asynchronously with Rails in
    JSON.

  <h1>Biggest Challenges</h1>
  <p>
    It’s probably not a surprise that getting the frontend and backend to
    exchange data was the most difficult aspect of this project.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the backend, a major hurdle was formatting the JSON response to the GET
    request so each restaurant is passed as an object containing an array of its
    own dishes.

  <p>
    This data structure is what allows me to present it to the user on the
    frontend in a way that makes sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    Displaying the data received and attaching event listeners to the buttons
    presented another series of challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adding event listeners to the dynamically generated buttons and attaching
    fetch API methods to them were probably the biggest hurdles to overcome on
    the frontend.
  </p>
  <p>
    Essentially the entire UI is dynamically generated so I had to build POST
    and DELETE requests in to certain elements after using

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>
    Deceptively simply in its appearance, this project required quite a bit of
    craftsmanship in order to have what are essentially completely separate
    front and back ends share information.
