    The application I built is made with React and Redux on the front end and
    Rails in API mode on the back end.
  </p>
  <h1>About the app</h1>
  <p>
    The concept of the application is that users can create an account and keep
    track of all of the items on their wishlist from a single location.

    Transitioning right into the technology, Redux was definitely the most
    challenging aspect of creating this project. All of the boilerplate involved
    in set up is daunting and at first, down right confusing.

  <h1>Redux</h1>
  <p><i>Greatest Challenges</i></p>
  <p>
    The use case for Redux in my application is storing the current user logged
    in and making that available for all of the components that need it.
  </p>
  <p>
    My login page is not directly connected to the homepage so passing props
    around would have not been ideal. Instead, when the user clicks the button
    to authenticate their username and password, an action is called that
    dispatches to a reducer.
  </p>

      height="676"
      width="700"
      alt="redux 2" />
    <p id="caption">userAction.js</p>
  </div>
  <p>
    If log in is successful the server responds with a status code of 200 and
    the current user is store in global state. Else, an error message is stored
    in the Redux store that the Login page can access to display it on the DOM.
  </p>
  <h1>JWT</h1>
  <p>
    JWTs are generated in the server and sent to the browser to be stored in
    local storage. After a user is authenticated, this becomes the basis for
    further communication between the front and backend. Since they are
    encrypted and decoded with a secret key stored as and ENV variable, it makes
    the application more secure.
  </p>

  <p><i>Biggest Accomplishments</i></p>
  <p>
    Circling back to Redux, while it was quite difficult to grasp initially, it
    is very powerful.
  </p>
  <p>
    It makes development in React have much more potential since state sharing
    can occur between essentially any components in the application.
  </p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>
    I’m happy with how the app turned out and am humbled each time I work on
    another project how difficult styling (CSS, SASS) is and have come to
    appreciate it much more.
